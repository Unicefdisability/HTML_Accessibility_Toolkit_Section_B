				<strong>
					<span>Dr Omar Abdi, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Programmes: </span>
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>UNICEF works across more than 190 countries and territories, promoting the rights and wellbeing of every child in everything we do.   UNICEF advocates for and supports governments to create enabling environments and equal opportunities for all children to survive and thrive, including the over 240 million boys and girls with disabilities living in the world today. </span>
			</p>
<p>Our work on disability inclusion is mandated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and aligned with the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS) and the UNICEF  Strategic Plan. With the 2017 Executive Directive on Accessibility in Programme-Related Construction Activities (CF/EXD/2017-004), UNICEF  reaffirms its commitment to ensure physical accessibility is a principle for all the infrastructure that is built through our programmes, including in humanitarian action. </p>
<p>This toolkit is a result of extensive consultations with UNICEF employees, partners and persons with disabilities.  It’s a set of technical resources that will help our staff to promote and support accessibility and inclusion across our programmes and operations.  </p>
<p>We invite UNICEF colleagues and partners to apply this guidance in their work, to ensure that construction related to our programmes, such as school buildings, health clinics, water and sanitation facilities, are free of environmental barriers.  </p>

			<p>
				<strong>
					<span>Hannan Sulieman, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Management: </span>
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>UNICEF is committed to promote an accessible and inclusive work environment for every employee and is investing to increase opportunities for persons with disabilities to join our workforce. This Accessibility Toolkit is an important resource to help us deliver on this commitment, respecting and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in programmes and operations across the organization.  </span>
			</p>
<p><span>In 2014, a staff survey on accessibility of UNICEF programmes and premises revealed that 84 per cent of offices required awareness-raising materials and technical capacity on accessibility.  In a follow-up All-Staff Survey in 2019, only 39 per cent of respondents deemed their office space was physically accessible for persons with disabilities.   </span></p>
<p><span>To address the growing internal demand for resources to improve our office buildings, we established a  Greening and Accessibility Fund, developed guidance to support renovations for environmentally friendly and accessible premises and set up the Environmental Footprint and Accessibility Assessment Tool (EFAAT). </span></p>
<p><span>Data as of 2021 shows us that 52 per cent of UNICEF premises meet “level 1”, the minimum organisational requirements for accessibility. But we can do better, and we must do better.  UNICEF’s Strategic Plan Indicator E2.5 on Percentage of UNICEF offices that are disability inclusive and accessible, sets a target of 100% by 2025.  This is an ambitious target, but for UNICEF’s 100% organizational commitment on disability inclusion, only a target of 100% of accessibility in our premises and operations can be acceptable. </span> </p>

				<span>This toolkit was developed so the work of UNICEF programmes can support children like nine-year-old Amal, a girl with a physical disability who lives in Zaatari camp and who can now play with other children because the local playground has been made accessible to all. It can support children like Frinpali, a seven- year-old boy who uses a wheelchair and now receives appropriate education in Burkina Faso because his school has been made accessible. This toolkit has been conceived as an instrument to facilitate the dialogue with partners and the involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) on accessibility-related issues. And it has been developed with UNICEF’s current and future employees with disabilities and other organizations in mind, so that the facilities they work in are made more accessible and inclusive for all.</span>

The personnel may include people who are in charge of security at entrances and at the reception and of facilities management, as well as those involved in emergency evacuation, etc. While this toolkit addresses issues related to physical accessibility, simultaneous actions are also required to sensitize and train key personnel on the inclusion of persons with disabilities.

						<span id="id_314" class="normalized">
							<span>is an international human rights treaty of the United Nations intended to protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. It was adopted on 13 December 2006 and describes human rights frameworks linked to accessibility, aspects of universal design, reasonable accommodation and international standards for accessibility. UNICEF’s existing commitments and policies to promote accessibility are aligned with the CRPD.</span>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p id="id_315">
						<span>The accessibility of spaces and places determines the extent to which everyone – including persons with disabilities, older persons and children – can live, work and learn independently and participate fully and equally in society. Equal access to transportation, media, information and communication technologies, and public services and facilities, such as schools, libraries and town halls, facilitates the participation of persons with disabilities, in both urban and rural communities. Accessibility is also critical in emergency contexts, such as refugee camps, to ensure access to humanitarian services and facilities.</span>
					</p>
					<p id="id_316">
						<span>As of October 2021,184 countries have ratified the CRPD and, increasingly, countries around the world have adopted standards, codes and laws to mandate accessibility, in line with CRPD requirements.</span>
					</p>
					<p id="id_317">
						<span>Accessibility is one of the primary principles of the CRPD, set out in article 3 as a vital precondition for the effective and equal enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for persons with disabilities, for example to health, education, information and communication. Other CRPD articles related to accessibility are article 9: Accessibility; article 19: Living independently and being included in the community; article 24: Education; and article 30: Participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport.</span>

					<a id="noteref_2" href="#c002" class="footnote">2</a>
					<span class="normalized" id="id_321">

				<p id="id_322">
					<span>Seven principles underpin the concept of universal design, summarized as follows:</span>
				</p>
				<ol id="id_323">
					<li id="id_324">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_325">Equitable use: </strong> Providing the same means of use for all users, with and without disabilities</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_326">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_327">Flexibility in use: </strong> Accommodating individual preferences and abilities, such as left- or right-handedness</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_328">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_329">Simple and intuitive use: </strong> Ensuring easy to understand utilization, including for people with low literacy</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_330">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_331">Perceivable information: </strong>Communicating key information clearly and in multiple ways</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_332">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_333">Error tolerance: </strong> Minimizing hazards and adverse consequences of accidental actions</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_334">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_335">Low physical effort: </strong> Requiring little operating force to use</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_336">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_337">Size and space: </strong> Providing appropriate space for reach and use, if seated or standing</span>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p id="id_338">
					<span>The outcome of using universal design is that environments, buildings and products are inclusive of, usable by and accessible to everyone, to the greatest possible extent, including children, adults and older persons with and without disabilities, pregnant women, parents with children or using baby strollers, and people carrying heavy equipment, suitcases, groceries, etc.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_339">
					<span>The concept of universal design applies to almost every area of life. While this toolkit focuses on the accessibility of infrastructure and spaces, the concept also applies to many other areas, programmes and services, such as mobility (e.g., accessible cars, buses or trains; inclusive bus stations; accessible communication on mobility-related web platforms), communication (e.g., inclusive events, sign language interpretation; meetings or lessons; easy-to-read publications; accessible posters) and information and communication technology (e.g., accessible web services and mobile apps; audiovisual content with captions and transcriptions; accessible files and software).</span>

					<span>The accessibility continuum</span>
				</h2>
				<p id="id_343">
					<span>The accessibility continuum is a concept that describes the experience of children, adults with disabilities and older persons departing from their homes, using pathways, crossing roads and taking transportation to reach, enter and use services and facilities. These facilities can be libraries, public meeting halls, sports fields, health care facilities, courthouses, marketplaces, conference rooms, office buildings, etc. A continuous route means that circulating through it is safe, unrestricted and possible using a wheelchair, a walking frame or a service dog, with no obstacles or barriers blocking the way. Such a route must be continuous because, like in a chain, if one link is broken, the chain is compromised.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_344">
					<span class="normalized" id="id_345">
						<span>Four steps ensure the accessibility continuum: reaching a facility; entering a facility; moving around a facility; and using specific features of a facility. </span>
					</span>
					<a href="#c004" class="footnote" id="noteref_4">4</a>
					<span class="normalized" id="id_346">
						<span>These align with the RECU methodology that stipulates that accessible facilities should be <strong id="id_347">easy to reach, enter, circulate and use. </strong>
						</span>
					</span>
					<a class="footnote" id="noteref_5" href="#c005">5</a>
				</p>
				<p id="id_348">
					<span>Planning for an accessible environment requires a broad vision of the accessibility continuum perspective. For example, if the route from home to school is accessible for a child who uses crutches but there are stairs at the school entrance and classroom doors are hard to push and pull, the child will have difficulty entering the school or learning and participating in activities with his/her peers.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_349">
					<span>Similarly, if a UNICEF staff member using a wheelchair has an adjustable desk, an accessible work space with appropriate doorway sizes and accessible toilets, he/she will be able to work on an equal basis with others. However, if he/she is unable to independently access the building because there is no accessible parking space, drop- off zone or kerb (ramp) to get on the sidewalk, the overall accessibility of the workplace is compromised.</span>

					<span>Many of the technical specifications in this toolkit are based on International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, developed by a committee of experts. In particular, ISO 21542:2011 ‘Building construction – Accessibility and usability of the built environment’ applies to construction and the modification of new and existing buildings and is available to UNICEF staff via the Supply Division.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_407">
					<span>Related ISO standards cover accessible lifts (4190-1), emergencies (22320), assistive devices such as tactile walking surface indicators (23599) and graphical symbols for public information and accessibility (7001). Some of the common global symbols used for accessibility are available in the Toolbox.</span>

						<span>For UNICEF programmes, ISO 21542 can be applied to all construction-related activities. While dimensions in the standard are geared primarily towards adults, it also recognizes that people across age levels have different needs, so it incorporates, for example, accessibility in toilets designed for children. In addition, accessibility for children is considered in this toolkit based on other existing guidelines and principles. </span>

In situations when all units cannot be made accessible, a minimum number of units should comply with accessibility standards based on the nature of the facility and the population it serves. For example, [when gender separated accessible toilets are not possible or practical] ensuring that there is at least one accessible unisex latrine in every school.” </span>

					<p id="id_780">
						<span>Planning is an essential precursor to successful construction projects, which is also the case regarding accessibility considerations.

					</p>
					<p id="id_785">

							<span>Budget for accessibility</span>
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p id="id_789">
						<span>The <strong id="id_790">overall detailed implementation plan, project budget and detailed design</strong> should incorporate cost estimates for accessibility. As most building codes include accessibility requirements, these costs will be part of achieving code compliance.</span>
					</p>
					<p id="id_791">
						<span id="id_792" class="normalized">
							<span>External studies indicate that the costs of meeting accessibility standards vary between 0.47 per cent and 2.75 per cent when considered in the planning and design phase of new construction activities. </span>

					<p id="id_794">
						<span>Therefore, it is appropriate to allocate an extra 1–3 per cent of funds for this purpose to make sure the design elements and necessary accessibility features are incorporated. (Please note that this is an estimate, which therefore may vary.) Factors that can affect this estimate include the size of the building, the number of floors, the complexity of functions within the building, the extent to which accessibility has to be taken into account, the location and the availability of materials, etc.</span>

						<span>Programmatic construction (and therefore accessibility improvements) may be directly or indirectly managed by UNICEF, including through partnerships. When initiating a new construction activity, a first step is for the project team to identify the project brief or ToR with partners and beneficiaries.

					<p id="id_916">
						<span>UNICEF may construct facilities and buildings such as schools, health centres and latrines with simple technical designs, often using concrete and brickwork construction. However, many projects that UNICEF supports are complex, particularly in the context of a humanitarian setting. While most of the buildings will require the same accessibility features, some adaptation will be needed based on the purpose and type of facility (health clinic, school, etc.).</span>
					</p>
					<p id="id_917">
						<span>With the support of users with disabilities, clearly defining from the beginning the services that will be hosted by the facility, the dimensions, specific features (security, privacy, accessibility, etc.) is crucial to ensure that the design will be effective and that it will respond to the actual needs of the project’s beneficiaries.</span>

					<p id="id_920">
						<span>New construction should be seen as an opportunity to create something new and ‘better’, and renovations and reconstructions should be used as an occasion to improve on what was available before in order to ‘build it back better’. Even though ‘better’ is a wide concept (that can sometimes be replaced by ‘safer’), it can be used to define every improvement in terms of usability, performance, functionality, etc. Accessibility should naturally be part of what is considered ‘better’, which means that interventions concerning infrastructure at all stages should be devised taking universal design into consideration.</span>

						<span>As part of the design process, it is helpful to understand and identify the context, aims, routines, needs and priorities of the people who will use each building or facility. For example, the appraisal of a primary school design will consider playgrounds or child-friendly toilets and shared spaces, which may not be part of medical facilities or office buildings.</span>
					</p>
					<p id="id_926">
						<span>UNICEF staff and partners can prioritize areas for review or assessment, in line with a sequenced approach that demonstrates a commitment to inclusion and accessibility:</span>
					</p>
					<ul id="id_927">
						<li id="id_928">
							<span>Use sample or model plans that have successfully integrated accessibility features as a reference for the designers/architects, who will then have to adapt them to the specific project under consideration.</span>
						</li>
						<li id="id_929">
							<span>Make sure that safe exits (egress) and evacuation have been considered in designs; it is vital in construction planning that emergency exits for people who may have difficulty evacuating premises independently, such as people using wheelchairs, be considered at the design and construction planning stages. Accessible exits are usually safer exits. Emergency, fire safety and other crisis-related plans should provide clear and accessible information on leaving and evacuating a building (egress) and provide safe and accessible methods of evacuation, including evacuation chairs.</span>
						</li>
						<li id="id_930">
							<span>Consider flexibility and accessibility when designs change; review and assess accessibility whenever the design and use of a space changes, taking into consideration that when a construction project ends and a building is occupied, the spaces may be rearranged by the users. Make sure spaces, including classroom, town halls and offices, remain flexible so layouts can be revised in the future.</span>
						</li>
						<li id="id_931">
							<span>Promote manoeuvrability and longer-term sustainability with less effort using furniture with wheels that also lock for safety; ideally, architects, construction firms and project managers will engage interior designers and emphasize the importance of accessibility– such as making sure that the surfaces of floors are not covered in rugs that are higher than a certain threshold that could make them a tripping hazard for a child or a person who is blind, or that are difficult to move onto for a person who uses a wheelchair.</span>
						</li>

					<p id="id_932">
						<strong id="id_933">
							<span>The location of the facility</span>
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p id="id_934">
						<span>Ideally, the location of buildings and facilities should be convenient to community members and children with disabilities: close to safe and accessible road crossings, pathways and transportation routes. They should be located far from hazardous waste or from areas prone to flooding, and should be as flat as possible to facilitate circulation.</span>

						<span>When the project involves larger construction or staff more directly implicated in construction activities (such as in the design or the works supervision team), it is imperative that their knowledge about accessibility be deeper and more technical.

						<li id="id_1002">
							<span>
								<strong id="id_1003">Train design teams on accessibility</strong> after the members are appointed and before they begin working on the project. In this case, the support of an accessibility consultant hired by UNICEF is essential to properly deliver the training to the design team.</span>

						<li id="id_1004">
							<span>
								<strong id="id_1005">Supervise and support design teams throughout the design phases. </strong> For particularly complex projects, project managers can consider hiring an accessibility specialist over the longer term to accompany the design teams and provide periodic ad hoc sessions to revise their work on accessibility.</span>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p id="id_1006">
						<span>Construction companies and builders would also benefit from training on accessibility, to better understand what it means, why it is important and how to implement it correctly. In general, however, and according to construction best practice, builders bear no responsibility for design activities; their role is to construct a building that is consistent with the project documents (drawings, BoQs, etc.). Therefore, accessibility capacity development should be considered for designers as well.</span>

				<p id="id_1081">
					<span>Once the design team is appointed, the needs of persons with disabilities have been identified, the design brief has been defined and the concerned staff has been trained, the architectural design and implementation phase can begin. This is a standard process, well known to professionals of the construction sector (UNICEF procurement officers and construction project managers, architects, engineers, construction companies, etc.). Therefore, these guidelines do not provide suggestions on how to manage the process but focus on the specific requirements concerning accessibility.</span>

					<p id="id_1083">
						<span>The technical quality of design documents is essential for every construction project, but it is particularly important to ensure that accessibility requirements are properly addressed. Design documents should provide the construction firm with all the needed information about what it must realize but are also useful to avoid disputes between the client (UNICEF, in this case) and the builder.</span>
					</p>
					<p id="id_1084">

					<span>C. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND MONITORING</span>
				</h2>
				<p id="id_1114">
					<span>A process of handover or contract finalization usually takes place once construction is completed. Furnishings (the type and position of counters, tables, bookshelves, etc.) and interior design considerations (the type and position of fitted carpets, built-in furniture, movable partitions, etc.) can add to (or detract from) the accessibility of premises or facilities. Furnishings that are not explicit in the design ToR should be reviewed.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_1115">
					<span>Prior to finalizing the contract with the construction firm, an accessibility consultant or task team should complete a final site visit to substantiate the on-site specifications. The assessment can then be provided to the designated quality inspector from the respective engineering or construction firm.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_1116">
					<span>The quality assurance process should include engaging with the contractors and consultants to check the coherence of the realized works against the project design (drawings, BoQs, technical specifications) and to verify the technical quality of the realized works.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_1117">
					<span>The egress (exiting) provisions and evacuation plans should be evaluated both during routine fire and emergency drills and as part of a post-occupancy assessment to make sure that persons with disabilities are adequately considered and able to safely evacuate in an emergency, with workable procedures and infrastructure in place to alert them and for evacuation. Areas for further attention should be reported to the project manager with an action plan.</span>

						<span>Increasing the awareness of partners and beneficiaries about the difficulties that persons with disabilities encounter in a non-accessible environment is crucial to promote effective changes towards inclusion.

					<span>Even though the extent and nature of accessibility refurbishments are often limited, attention should nonetheless be paid to the quality of the relative technical documents to ensure the quality of the realized works.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_1263">
					<span>Refurbishments are more frequent than new construction projects but they are often underestimated and entrusted to people without appropriate qualifications, and are not properly followed up.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_1264">
					<span>Often at the end of accessibility refurbishments, the project managers discover that the ramps are too steep, that the new doors are an obstacle for persons with visual impairments, that the renovated toilets are too narrow for wheelchair access, etc.</span>

				<p id="id_1265">
					<span>Various factors cause these problems, including:</span>

				<span>INCLUSIVE SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES</span>
			</h1>
			<p id="id_1329">
				<span>When renovating existing facilities to make them more accessible, special attention must be paid to safety and security measures adapted for persons with disabilities. Evacuation procedures, security plans and all emergency strategies in a building refurbished in the frame of a UNICEF project, regardless of the sector, must take into account the needs of persons with disabilities, to make sure that they are not left behind in case of an emergency.</span>
			</p>
			<p id="id_1330">
				<span>As a reference, the needs to consider include to:</span>
			</p>
			<ul id="id_1331">
				<li id="id_1332">
					<span>Make sure that security plans and SoPs take into account the needs of persons with different disabilities</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_1333">
					<span>Make sure that emergency alerts are provided in different formats: audio alarms, visual alarms, automated text messages by phone or email, etc.</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_1334">
					<span>Deliver training to the users of the building in accessible formats for all; train security focal points on how to take care of persons with disabilities during an emergency or an evacuation</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_1335">
					<span>Make sure that emergency exits are signposted in accessible ways, that emergency doors and staircases comply with accessibility standards, and that alternative escape routes are available for persons using a wheelchair (accessible ramps, evacuation chairs, etc.)</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_1336">
					<span>Involve persons with disabilities in the revision of architectural plans in terms of security, as well as in simulations and training</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_1337">
					<span>Make sure that sufficient evacuation chairs are available in each building and that security focal points know how to use them (see the specification for these chairs under the Toolbox)</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_1338">
					<span>Make sure that assembly areas and safe rooms/spaces (areas where people can gather and wait safely to be rescued) are accessible to all</span>
				</li>
				<li id="id_1339">
					<span>Consider accessibility and disability when developing SoPs in case of wider and more complex emergencies in a country (outburst of violence, civil war, natural disaster, etc.)</span>
